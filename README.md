## Introduction

**Canary** is a thin, C++11 wrapper over the SocketCAN API in Linux, which
enables communication over [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus)
using idioms from the [Boost.ASIO](https://github.com/boostorg/asio) and
[ASIO](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio) libraries.

## Dependencies

**Canary** depends only on ASIO and the C++11 standard library. By default, it
uses Boost.ASIO, but can be configured to use standalone ASIO. The
`CANARY_STANDALONE_ASIO` macro makes the library depend only on standalone ASIO.

Running tests requires lightweight test facilities from Boost.Core (which is a
header only library).

## Installation
**Canary** is header-only, so you only need to add the include directory to the
include paths in your build system. An `install` target is available in CMake
which will install the headers and a CMake `find_package` configuration script
for easy consumption in projects built with CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

After installation, a project built with CMake can consume the library using
`find_package`:
```cmake
find_package(canary REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_target PUBLIC canary::canary)
```

## Running tests
Tests require the existence of 2 virtual CAN interfaces - `vcan0` and `vcan1`,
which can be created with the `create_vcans.sh` script:
```
sudo tools/create_vcans.sh vcan0 vcan1
```

Tests can be run using the standard `test` target generated by CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make test
```
